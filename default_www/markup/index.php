				<p class="intro">Welcome to the Fork CMS backend markup library. You'll find everything you need here to style your backend modules.</p>

				<hr />

					<li><a href="index.php#whatis">What is this?</a></li>

				</ol>

				<h3 id="whatis">What is this?</h3>

 				<p>This is a markup library where you can copy-paste pieces of markup from so you won&#x27;t need to write any HTML or CSS yourself.</p>

				<h3 id="why">Why?</h3>

				<p>There are a lot of default elements used in the backend of Fork CMS. Even our own developers can&#x27;t remember them all so we created this markup library. <br />
					In the table of contents on the left you will find links to markup for specific modules. Whenever you are in need of a way to visualize your input fields and other elements, be sure to check out the existing markup because you probably won&#x27;t need to write any code yourself. Just copy-paste the piece you need and it&#x27;ll look just fine.</p>
